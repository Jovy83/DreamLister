# DreamLister

My attempt at the DreamLister challenge.
So far there's 2 issues:
-adding a new Item causes the pickerview's 2nd column to produce an extra blank row
-an issue with saving a new Item with the same Store and ItemType overwrites a previous Item with the same Store and ItemType, and makes it a duplicate of the new Item
